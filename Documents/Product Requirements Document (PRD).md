# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

This PRD lays the groundwork for the DebtFreePlanner by clearly defining the productâ€™s purpose and target audience. The structure and content of this document are guided by the principles and methodologies outlined in [_Design a Better Business: New Tools, Skills, and Mindset for Strategy and Innovation_](https://designabetterbusiness.com/) by Pijl, Lokitz, and Solomon (2016). Additionally, insights from the [Product Mastery Now](https://productmasterynow.com/mastery/) podcast shape the approach, particularly within the "design and development" knowledge area of the "product innovation management" framework.

## 3. Market and Context

### 3.1. Problem Statement

Loan recipients struggle to manage multiple debts, leading to prolonged financial strain. This challenge arises from a lack of tools and knowledge that support practical debt management strategies such as Snowball, Avalanche, and Snowflake, as well as multicurrency support.

### 3.2. Market Analysis

#### 3.2.1. Direct Competitors

Direct competitors like [Debt Payoff Planner](https://www.debtpayoffplanner.com/), [Undebt.it](https://undebt.it/), [unbury.me](https://unbury.me/), and [Vertex42 Debt Reduction Calculator](https://www.vertex42.com/Calculators/debt-reduction-calculator.html) help users manage and pay down debt using strategies like Snowball and Avalanche. However, these tools lack multicurrency support and the ability to customize debt repayment plans as extensively as DebtFreePlanner.

#### 3.2.2. Indirect Competitors

Indirect competitors such as [Mint](https://www.mint.com/), [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/), [Quicken](https://www.quicken.com/), [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com/), and [Simplifi](https://www.quicken.com/simplifi) offer a broad range of financial management features, including budgeting and expense tracking, but do not support creating debt repayment plans.

#### 3.2.3. Strategic Opportunities

1. **Multicurrency Support**: None of the direct competitors offer multicurrency support or localization. DebtFreePlanner addresses this gap, making it uniquely suited for a global user base and providing a significant advantage in catering to diverse financial needs across different regions.

2. **AI-Driven Insights**: The use of AI for personalized recommendations and predictive analytics is an emerging area that none of the competitors have yet to fully embrace. While AI-driven insights are currently not on the roadmap, if implemented, DebtFreePlanner would be the first in the market to offer such advanced functionality, further solidifying its position as an innovative leader in debt management.

3. **API Integrations**: YNAB offers a well-documented official API that can be used to pull loans into DebtFreePlanner. This integration can be leveraged to create a symbiotic relationship, enhancing the overall user experience and data synchronization between the two tools.

### 3.3. Assumptions and Limitations

#### 3.3.1. Assumptions

- **Basic Financial Literacy:** Users have a basic understanding of financial concepts, such as compound interest and loan terms.
- **Basic Technology Proficiency:** Users are comfortable using online banking and personal finance apps.
- **Basic Computer Setup:** The application is primarily used on a laptop with an internet connection.
- **Data Accuracy:** Users will input correct financial information to ensure accurate calculations.

#### 3.3.2. Limitations

- **Data Privacy:** In addition to standard data privacy measures, DebtFreePlanner must implement GDPR and CCPA.
- **Platform Limitations:** DebtFreePlanner is designed as a web-based tool, which may limit its functionality on certain devices or when used offline.

### 3.4 Risks

#### 3.4.1 Risk of Low User Adoption Due to Intention-Action Gap

Loan recipients often intend to manage their finances better but fail to act on this intention due to several psychological factors:

- **Procrastination**: The overwhelming nature of financial management or uncertainty about where to begin can cause significant delays in starting the process.
- **Behavioral Inertia**: Users may struggle to break free from existing habits and routines, even when those habits are detrimental to their financial well-being.
- **Self-Regulation Challenges**: Users may initially be motivated to use the product, but as "Motivational Decline" sets in, maintaining discipline becomes difficult, leading to inconsistent use.
- **Cognitive Dissonance**: Users might avoid creating their debt reduction plan to sidestep confronting uncomfortable financial realities, resulting in disengagement.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- The product will incorporate features that encourage continuous user engagement, such as progress tracking, personalized reminders, and gamification.
- The UI/UX will implement "embedded learning" and offer tutorials to help users overcome initial barriers and stay committed to their financial goals.

#### 3.4.2 External Service Dependency Risks

The application may encounter challenges with the integration and reliability of third-party APIs and services.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Create a Proof of Concept (PoC) to validate technical feasibility before full-scale implementation.
- Design the software to be "fault-tolerant" and use vendor-agnostic development techniques to avoid being locked into a vendor that did not meet our needs.

#### 3.4.3 Public Repository Exposure

Because this is a portfolio project, the repository is public, increasing the likelihood of a successful cyberattack.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Implement the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and other SecOps best practices.

#### 3.4.4 Attractiveness as a Target

Since the app manages financial data, it is an attractive target (honeypot) for cybercriminals.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Minimize the collection of Personal Identifiable Information (PII) by avoiding unnecessary data such as bank account numbers, Social Security numbers, or full names, reducing the application's attractiveness as a target for cybercriminals.

[The Kano Model: A Step-By-Step Guide for Doing a Kano Analysis](https://leanscape.io/kano-model-customer-needs/)

### 6.1. Feature Set

#### 6.1.1. Primary Features

- **Snowflake Payments**

  - Enables small, irregular payments towards debts whenever extra funds are available, helping to reduce the principal faster.

- **Multicurrency Support**

  - Provides seamless handling of multiple currencies with automatic exchange rate updates, catering to a global user base.

- **Basic Reporting**

  - Generates essential reports and visualizations to help loan recipients understand and track their repayment plans.

- **Secure Data Handling:**
  - The application ensures that all sensitive user data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.

#### 6.1.2. Secondary Features

- **Data Portability:**

  - Users can export and import their data, allowing them to maintain control over their information and use it in other financial tools or reports.

- **Integration with Financial Tools**

  - Synchronizes with budgeting applications like YNAB and possibly Firefly III for seamless data management.

- **Advanced Reporting**

  - Offers enhanced reporting and visualizations that incorporate data storytelling techniques to provide deeper insights.

- **Multiple Plan Support**
- Users can create and manage multiple debt repayment plans, each with its own strategy and set of debts. This feature allows for the separate management of different financial goals or scenarios.

- **Multi-User Support**
  - Users can invite others to collaborate on specific debt repayment plans, granting them either read-only or write permissions.
  - Admins can manage user roles within each plan, including the ability to revoke access or elevate users to admin status..

#### 6.1.3. Potential Features

The following features are under consideration for future development but are not yet confirmed or scheduled for implementation.

- **AI-Driven Insights**

  - Provides personalized recommendations and predictive analytics to optimize repayment strategies.

- **Cross-Platform Accessibility**
  - Ensures accessibility across multiple devices, enhancing usability and engagement wherever the user is.

#### 6.1.4. Excluded Features

To ensure DebtFreePlanner remains focused on fulfilling its intended purpose, the following features and functionalities were deemed unviable due to the complexity of their implementation or specific market needs.

- **Budgeting and Expense Tracking**

  - DebtFreePlanner will not include general budgeting or expense tracking features, including loan payment history tracking. These functionalities are excluded because many established applications already perform them well, and these features are complementary rather than central to the problem DebtFreePlanner is addressing. Users are encouraged to use tools like YNAB (You Need A Budget) or Firefly III, which may be integrated with DebtFreePlanner in the future.

- **Non-Conventional Loan Types**

  - DebtFreePlanner will only support the most common loan types (e.g., mortgages, student loans, and credit card debt). Non-conventional loan types, such as payday loans, interest-only loans, or cryptocurrency loans, are not supported due to a lack of market demand.

- **Advanced Loan Features**

  - Advanced loan features, such as variable interest rates and early termination fees, are out of scope due to the complexity of accommodating all possible business rules of financial institutions. Users will need to update loan terms manually when they change.

- **Business-Oriented Features**
  - DebtFreePlanner will not offer features intended primarily for business owners, given that large businesses would likely not trust this tool, and features targeting personal finances can typically meet the needs of small business owners.

### 6.2. Gain Creators

- Reduce interest payments, accelerating the journey to financial independence.
- Provide clear, actionable insights to improve financial health.

### 6.3. Pain Relievers

- Simplify the process of managing multiple debts, reducing financial stress.
- Integrate with existing financial tools for a seamless user experience.

#### 8.1.6. **PFS Integration Management**

**Purpose:** Manages the integration of the application with external personal finance software (PFS), allowing users to synchronize their data for a more comprehensive financial overview.

**Note:** The integration with external personal finance software (PFS), such as YNAB and Firefly III, is still under consideration and has not yet been added to the project roadmap. For this reason, a user flow will not be created at this stage. When the integration is addressed, virtually all aspects will be dictated by the APIs of these platforms, reducing the need for custom user flow.

- **ðŸš§ 8.1.6.1. YNAB Management:** Handles integration with YNAB, allowing users to import or export budget data.
- **ðŸš§ 8.1.6.2. Firefly III Management:** Manages the connection with Firefly III, enabling data synchronization between the two platforms.

**Implemented under module:** Integration Management

> **ðŸš§ Note:** Features marked with ðŸš§ are still under consideration and have not yet been added to the roadmap. The diagrams for these features are rough drafts or do not exist. If the feature is ultimately included, it will be further detailed in this document; otherwise, it will be removed.

### 8.2. Wireframes

Only the wireframes for the **Debt-Free Plan Management** section will be created, as it is the only section with unique and critical user interactions. Other sections, such as the subscription and user profile, follow standard, well-known patterns and will not significantly benefit from the feedback wireframes typically provide.

Additionally, [user flow diagrams](#81-user-flows) have already been established for most of these sections, ensuring that interactions are clearly defined.

In line with the Agile principle of creating **just enough** documentation, wireframes for these standard sections will not be created.

#### 8.2.1. **Debt-Free Plan Management**

- **8.2.1.1. Plan Overview**  
  Displays a list of existing debt plans with quick actions such as "Create New Plan," "Edit," or "Delete." This gives users an overview of their progress and the ability to manage multiple plans.
- **8.2.1.2. Plan Details**  
  Shows comprehensive details of a selected plan, including debt breakdowns, repayment strategies, and a timeline. Users can adjust the plan dynamically, modify strategies, and track their progress in real-time.

- **8.2.1.3. Debt Management**  
  Provides an interface for adding, editing, or deleting individual debts within a plan. Users will input loan details such as amount, interest rate, minimum payment, due dates, and repayment status.

- **8.2.1.4. Snowflake Management**  
  A specialized interface for managing irregular or one-time payments, allowing users to add or adjust payments. This section visualizes how these payments impact overall debt reduction and repayment timelines.

- **8.2.1.5. Plan Collaboration**  
  Allows users to invite collaborators to their debt repayment plan, set permission levels (e.g., read-only, edit, admin), and manage roles. Invitations are sent via email, and the system tracks collaborator activity within the plan.
