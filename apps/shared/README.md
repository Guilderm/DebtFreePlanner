# Shared Utilities

This folder is intended for shared code, utilities, and modules that can be reused across different parts of the **DebtFreePlanner** application.

## Purpose

The `shared` directory is designed to:

- Contain reusable utilities, helper functions, and common modules.
- Facilitate code sharing between the `public-site`, `pwa-client`, and `pwa-server` apps.
- Promote a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in the project.

## Current Status

This folder is currently empty and includes this placeholder file to maintain its structure during the early stages of development.

## Planned Content

In the future, this folder may include:

- **Constants**: Shared application-wide constants.
- **Utils**: Helper functions like date formatting, number formatting, etc.
- **Interfaces and Types**: Shared TypeScript interfaces and types.
- **Validation Schemas**: Common validation schemas using libraries like `class-validator` or `yup`.

## Notes

- Avoid including app-specific logic here; keep it generic and reusable.
- Once this folder is populated, consider removing this README if it's no longer necessary.
